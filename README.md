# EGO-Planner-v2
Swarm Playground, the codebase of the paper "[Swarm of micro flying robots in the wild](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abm5954)".

The tutorial PDF file with corresponding videos are embedded in [swarm-playground.7z](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/EGO-Planner-v2/blob/main/swarm-playground.7z).

This work was born out of [MINCO](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/GCOPTER).
If you find it interesting, please give both repos stars generously. Thanks.



This software (version Dec. 2021) was originally planned to be attached directly to the Supplementary Materials of the paper, but was missed due to miscommunication.
We will contact editors to add the codebase on weekdays. Before that, please download it here. Sorry for the inconvenience. 2022-5-7.
